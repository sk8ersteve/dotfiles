Things that shouldn't be here:
- .expo
- .steam* (3 things, it's the games' faults)
- .vscode-oss (I have no idea why this is needed)
- .Xauthority (caused issues with Steam, need to retest)

Things to do:
- Fancy grub boot menu
- Fine tune gpu/cpu performance

Misc:
- .Xauthority has been removed but I'm still concerned about this
